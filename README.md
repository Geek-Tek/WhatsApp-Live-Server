# WhatsApp Live Server
WhatsApp Web Chrome extension allows users to read messages while they're written.  
You won't need to wait until the other person finshes to write the message and send it.  
Live chats are a lot more interesting and engaging, it's a new way of communication.

## Worth note:
This is the WhatsApp Live Chrome extension's server. If you want to see or change the extension-side code you can go [here](https://github.com/Geek-Tek/WhatsApp-Live).  
The actual Chrome extension can be founded on the [Chrome WebStore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/whatsapp-live/ohcpfmdkhhcfhcigeigigpmlngohloea)

## About the project
- `server.js` does basically all the backend in the server
- `package.json` is the usual NodeJS file
- `public/` is the folder with the website for [supporting the project](https://whatsapp-live.glitch.me/)
- `tutorial/` is the folder with the [tutorial website](https://whatsapp-live.glitch.me/tutorial/)

## Additional info:
This extension was made in only a month by a 17 years old solo programmer without any previous knowledge of NodeJS, Express, Socket.io, GitHub or even Chrome extensions programming.
So please be kind and collaborative, help me improving this really fun project, thanks ; )
